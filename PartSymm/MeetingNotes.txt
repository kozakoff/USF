Count of meta genes for HC compared to FGA

How the genes are place in relationship to the chunk boundaries for both FGA and HC

Hamming distance how far apart 

When the genotype mutates, calculate the hamming distance of phenotypes before and after mutation to see if mutation rate is the driver?

Normalized average fitness

eiben - Parameter tuning book

1. paramater sweep
2. meta parameter
3. Self adaptive operators

Add R3 and Dynamic Pattern Tracking?

How many meta genes are in the metamask for HC?
How many meta genes are in the FGA on Average/Max/Min?

Ideas for Comp Arch paper on EA and Hardware 
-GECCO
-CEC
-Porting code to run on GPU w/Evolutionary Algorithm
-Circuit design

Dynamic pattern tracking
-Using EA to evolve a genome to match a pattern like 00001111 or 11001100, then, the pattern changes after some period of generations.
-Use Hamming distance to determine fitness 
-Look in Team folders
-Probably some info in previous version of overleaf proposal
