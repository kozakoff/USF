Count of meta genes for HC compared to FGA

How the genes are place in relationship to the chunk boundaries for both FGA and HC

Hamming distance how far apart 

When the genotype mutates, calculate the hamming distance of phenotypes before and after mutation to see if mutation rate is the driver?

Normalized average fitness

eiben - Parameter tuning book

1. paramater sweep
2. meta parameter
3. Self adaptive operators

Add R3 and Dynamic Pattern Tracking?

How many meta genes are in the metamask for HC?
How many meta genes are in the FGA on Average/Max/Min?
