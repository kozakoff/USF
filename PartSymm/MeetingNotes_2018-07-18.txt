Meeting notes from 2018-07-18


Count of meta genes for HC compared to FGA

How the genes are place in relationship to the chunk boundaries for both FGA and HC

Hamming distance how far apart 

When the genotype mutates, calculate the hamming distance of phenotypes before and after mutation to see if mutation rate is the driver?

Normalized average fitness
